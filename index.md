Payment is by bank transfer to Michael Donaghy, sort code 11-04-05, account number 01241805; for international transfers you may need IBAN GB36HLFX11040501241805 and/or BIC HLFXGB21L76. Please include your surname and EMA number in the reference for the transfer, and ensure any fees are paid on your side - I recommend [Transferwise](https://transferwise.com/) as it's often cheaper than using a bank for international payment.

## Suggested Accomodation

The [YHA London Lee Valley](https://www.yha.org.uk/hostel/london-lee-valley) offers youth hostel accommodation at low prices, right at the tournament venue.

The newly-built [Premier Inn Tottenham Hale](https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/england/greater-london/london/london-tottenham-hale.html) has good standard accomodation just outside Tottenham Hale station, a 10-minute direct train journey to/from the tournament venue.

The [Cheshunt Mariott Hotel](https://www.marriott.co.uk/hotels/travel/stnch-cheshunt-marriott-hotel/) is a luxury option, but be warned it's at the other end of Cheshunt (35 minute walk, or a 5-minute bus ride and two 10-minute walks).
